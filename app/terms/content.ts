## Last Updated: 2026 Jan 17

These Terms of Service, including the Zelo Privacy Policy (available at: **[https://zelo.sh/privacy](https://zelo.sh/privacy)**) (together, these “Terms”), are a legally binding contract between you and **Agent Velo, LLC** (“Agent Velo,” “Zelo,” “we,” or “us”) regarding your use of the Service. Collectively, our website at **[https://zelo.sh](https://zelo.sh)**, along with our related websites, hosted applications, downloadable applications (including the Zelo CLI), APIs, documentation, and other services provided by us constitute the “Service.”

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:**

**BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, OR DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE OUR PERMISSION TO USE THE SERVICE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND ZELO’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY ZELO AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.**

**NOTICE OF ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.** Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 15, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and by accepting these Terms, you and Zelo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action or representative proceeding.

## 1. Zelo Service Overview

Zelo provides developer tools and agentic workflows powered by machine learning and large language models (collectively, “AI Models”) to assist with software development tasks. The Service may provide suggested code, patches, explanations, commands, configurations, documentation drafts, test plans, refactors, or other outputs (collectively, “Suggestions”).

Zelo may operate in multiple modes, including:

* a local or client-side experience (for example, the Zelo CLI),
* a hosted or cloud experience (for example, web apps, managed endpoints, or APIs), and
* integrations with third-party services and model providers.

You acknowledge that the Service is a tool to assist you, and that you are responsible for the use of the Service and for verifying any Suggestions before relying on them.

---

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., 18 years old in the United States) or 18 years old, whichever is higher. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations.

If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.

---

## 3. Accounts and Registration

To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register, you may be required to provide us with information such as your name, email address, billing information, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you should immediately notify us at **[support@zelo.sh](mailto:support@zelo.sh)**.

---

## 4. General Payment Terms

Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as required by law.

### 4.1 Price

Zelo reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. We will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information.

We may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if we give you advance notice of changes before they apply through the Service user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.

You will be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on Zelo’s net income. Zelo may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

### 4.2 Payment Processing

Notwithstanding any amounts owed to Zelo, **Zelo does not directly process payment for any services.** To facilitate payment for the Service, we may use third-party payment processors such as Stripe and its affiliates (“Payment Processors”). Payment processing services are provided by Payment Processors and are subject to their applicable terms, conditions, and privacy policies (collectively, the “Processor Agreements”). By using payment functions of the Service, you agree to be bound by the Processor Agreements, as modified from time to time.

Zelo assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Service or for any acts or omissions of Payment Processors.

### 4.3 Subscription Service

The Service may include subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). The “Subscription Billing Date” is the date when you purchase your first subscription. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select (the “Initial Subscription Period”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (each, a “Subscription Period”) unless you cancel or we terminate it.

If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Zelo or its third-party Payment Processors to periodically charge all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period.

You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing for the next Subscription Period. You may cancel by using the cancellation functionality in your billing menu or by contacting us at **[support@zelo.sh](mailto:support@zelo.sh)**. Your cancellation must be received before the renewal date to avoid charges.

### 4.4 Delinquent Accounts

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due, a delinquent account may be charged fees incidental to any chargeback or collection, including collection fees.

If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal fee is due, we reserve the right to suspend access and, where permitted by law, delete your account and associated data without liability.

## 5. Licenses

### 5.1 Limited License

Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, Zelo grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to access and use the Service.

## 7. Ownership; Proprietary Rights

### 7.1 Rights to the Service and Materials

Zelo shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to the Service. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code, products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service, and all improvements, enhancements, customizations, or modifications thereto (collectively, “Materials”) are protected by intellectual property and other laws.

All Materials included in the Service are the property of Zelo or its third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized, you may not make use of the Materials. There are no implied licenses in these Terms and Zelo reserves all rights not granted expressly.

---

## 8. AI; Model Risks; Output Responsibility

This Section 8 applies to any AI Models, Suggestions, agentic workflows, or automated actions produced by or through the Service.

### 8.1 Suggestions; No Professional Advice

You may use the Service to generate Suggestions based on the input provided by you. Suggestions may include code changes, commands, configuration recommendations, security guidance, dependency selections, refactors, documentation, or other content.

Suggestions are generated automatically and are not professional advice. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for:

* reviewing and validating Suggestions before use,
* ensuring compatibility with your systems and requirements,
* evaluating safety, security, and compliance implications, and
* deciding whether to implement Suggestions.

### 8.2 Model Limitations and Risk Allocation

You acknowledge that AI Models and Suggestions have inherent limitations and may:

(a) contain errors, vulnerabilities, or misleading information;

(b) omit important details, tests, or edge cases;

(c) produce output that is out of context or not suited for your environment;

(d) recommend actions that may cause downtime, data loss, security incidents, cost increases, or other harms;

(e) reflect biases present in training data;

(f) generate repetitive, formulaic, or non-original content;

(g) generate content that may implicate third-party rights or licenses;

(h) behave unpredictably in complex tasks requiring judgment.

You agree that you bear all risks associated with the use of Suggestions, including any reliance on accuracy, completeness, legality, or usefulness.

### 8.3 Output Similarity

You acknowledge that Suggestions are generated by probabilistic systems and may be similar to or the same as outputs provided to other users. No rights to outputs generated for other users are granted to you.

### 8.4 Your Responsibility for Actions Taken by Agents

The Service may include agentic features that can propose or perform actions such as editing files, creating patches, running commands, opening pull requests, modifying infrastructure as code, or interacting with third-party services.

You acknowledge and agree that:

* you control whether and when to grant permissions, credentials, tokens, or system access to the Service;
* you are responsible for reviewing and approving any actions before execution where approval controls are provided;
* if you enable auto-execution or unattended modes, you assume responsibility for the consequences of actions taken;
* you are responsible for maintaining backups and safeguards appropriate to your environment.

### 8.5 Security-Sensitive Use

You will not use the Service as the sole basis to make decisions in high-risk contexts where failures could lead to significant harm, including decisions relating to critical infrastructure, safety systems, or regulated environments, unless you implement appropriate human review and controls.

### 8.6 No Warranties for AI Outputs

Any Suggestions are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind. This allocation of risk is an essential basis of the bargain between you and Zelo.

---

## 9. Customer and Usage Data

### 9.1 Customer Data

Any data, text, source code, prompts, files, repositories, or other content that you submit, upload, or transmit to the Service (“Customer Data”) is used to provide the Service and generate Suggestions.

Unless you opt in, Zelo will not use Customer Data to train or improve AI Models. Where privacy or “no-train” settings are offered, the Service will use Customer Data only to provide real-time functionality, subject to the operational needs described in the Privacy Policy.

You represent and warrant that you have all rights and permissions necessary to provide Customer Data to the Service and to authorize Zelo to process it as described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.

### 9.2 Usage Data

Zelo may collect, generate, and derive performance, analytical, diagnostic, or usage data relating to your access to or use of the Service (“Usage Data”). Usage Data does not include Customer Data. Zelo may use Usage Data to provide the Service, monitor performance and stability, prevent abuse, address technical issues, and improve the Service.

Zelo may anonymize and aggregate Usage Data and use it for product improvement, analytics, and benchmarking.

---

## 10. Third-Party Services; Model Providers; Integrations

The Service may interoperate with or incorporate third-party services, APIs, repositories, identity providers, or model providers (“Third-Party Services”). Your use of Third-Party Services may be subject to separate terms and policies. Zelo does not control Third-Party Services and is not responsible for their availability, security, functionality, or content.

You are responsible for complying with Third-Party Service terms, including API usage restrictions, acceptable use policies, and licensing terms.

---

## 11. Communications

We may send you emails or other messages concerning the Service, including transactional communications and service announcements. You may opt out of promotional communications as described in the Privacy Policy or by following unsubscribe instructions.

---

## 12. Modification of Terms

We may, from time to time, change these Terms. If we make material modifications, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of these Terms and by maintaining a current version at **[https://zelo.sh/terms](https://zelo.sh/terms)** (or a successor URL), and we may provide additional notice through the Service, email, or other reasonable means.

All modifications will be effective when posted. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.

---

## 14. Indemnity

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Service, and you will defend and indemnify Zelo, its affiliates, and their respective members, managers, officers, employees, contractors, and agents (together, the “Zelo Entities”) from and against any claim brought by a third party, and any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or connected with: (1) your unauthorized use or misuse of the Service; (2) your violation of these Terms; (3) your violation of any third-party right; or (4) any dispute between you and any third party.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification, and you agree to cooperate.

## 15. Disclaimers; No Warranties

**THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING SUGGESTIONS, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.** ZELO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

ZELO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING SUGGESTIONS, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.

No advice or information obtained through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain warranty disclaimers. In such jurisdictions, the disclaimers will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

---

## 16. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

(a) in no event will any Zelo Entity be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to your access to or use of, or your inability to access or use, the Service, including Suggestions, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, statute, or any other legal theory, and whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of damage; and

(b) the aggregate liability of the Zelo Entities to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms is limited to the greater of: (i) the amount you have paid to Zelo for access to and use of the Service in the six (6) months prior to the event giving rise to the claim; or (ii) USD $100.

Each provision providing for a limitation of liability is intended to allocate risks between the parties and is an essential element of the bargain.

---

## 17. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

Please read this section carefully as it affects your rights.

### 17.1 Agreement to Arbitrate

This Section 17 is referred to as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims between you and Zelo arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Service, advertising, or any aspect of the relationship will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.

You and Zelo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The Federal Arbitration Act governs interpretation and enforcement.

### 17.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions

You and Zelo agree that each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join claims or preside over any consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.

### 17.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

Before initiating arbitration, the party must send a written Notice of Dispute describing the claim and the relief sought. If the parties do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) days after Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.

### 17.4 Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.

### 17.5 Costs of Arbitration

Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise required by law or determined by the arbitrator.

### 17.6 Confidentiality

All aspects of arbitration proceedings will be confidential to the fullest extent permitted by law.

### 17.7 Severability

If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is held unenforceable, it will be modified to the extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder will remain in effect.

### 17.8 Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement

If Zelo makes a future change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject the change by sending written notice within thirty (30) days of the change.

---

If you reside in Canada, certain limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

### 18.5 Republic of Korea

If you reside in the Republic of Korea, certain provisions may be interpreted in accordance with mandatory consumer protection laws. Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit statutory consumer rights.

### 18.6 Other Jurisdictions

If you reside in a jurisdiction that does not permit certain limitations, those limitations apply only to the maximum extent permitted.

Beta Features may be unstable, incomplete, or inaccurate, and may result in errors, data loss, or other disruptions. Zelo makes no commitments regarding the continued availability or performance of Beta Features.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Beta Features are provided “as is” and are excluded from any service level commitments or warranties.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms without notice.

The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time. A waiver of any breach will not be a waiver of any subsequent breach.

Section headers are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. The word “including” means “including but not limited to.”
