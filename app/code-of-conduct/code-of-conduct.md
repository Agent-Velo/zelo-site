## Last Updated: 2025 Jan 16

## 0. Purpose & Philosophy

Zelo is a developer‑first AI ecosystem. We aim to foster a community where people can collaborate, ship, and learn—safely and respectfully. This Code of Conduct ("CoC") makes our shared values explicit and sets clear expectations for participation.

**Attribution & License.** Inspired by Mozilla’s Community Participation Guidelines and the Contributor Covenant. Licensed **CC BY‑SA 4.0** (see §12).

---

## 1. Scope

This CoC applies to all Zelo spaces and activities, online and offline, including but not limited to:

* Code repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
* Forums, Discord/Matrix, tickets, support channels, and email
* Documentation, websites, blogs, and social media when representing Zelo
* Meetups, hackathons, livestreams, workshops, and conferences

Conduct outside Zelo‑branded spaces may be considered when it has a material impact on community safety or trust (e.g., targeted harassment of Zelo participants, doxxing, credible threats).

---

## 2. Our Commitments

* **People First.** Respect people and diversity.
* **Openness.** Welcome different viewpoints and backgrounds.
* **Accountability.** Own your impact and your mistakes.
* **Safety.** Zero tolerance for harassment and credible threats of harm.

---

## 3. Expected Behavior

* **Be respectful.** Communicate with courtesy. If you cause harm, listen, apologize sincerely, and change the behavior going forward.
* **Be direct and professional.** Share candid feedback. Address ideas and behavior, not people.
* **Be inclusive.** Encourage diverse voices. Provide alternative ways to participate for remote attendees, non‑native speakers, people in other time zones, and those using pronouns beyond “he”/“she.”
* **Assume good intent, stay open.** Be willing to be wrong; update opinions when presented with new information.
* **Honor privacy and consent.** Respect confidential information and personal boundaries; seek affirmative consent for physical contact or sharing private material.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior (Non‑Exhaustive)

**4.1 Violence and Threats.** Prohibits threats of violence; incitement to self‑harm; stalking; and doxxing (posting others’ identifying information).

**4.2 Personal Attacks.** Insults, demeaning comments, mockery, or attacks on a person rather than their ideas.

**4.3 Derogatory or Discriminatory Conduct.** Harmful language or behavior related to any protected or personal attribute (e.g., background, family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race/ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity). Includes deliberate misgendering and repeated microaggressions after being asked to stop.

**4.4 Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact.** Sexualized comments, jokes, or imagery; non‑consensual touching (including hair, pregnancy, mobility devices, tattoos); physical intimidation or blocking; simulated contact (e.g., “kiss” emojis) without affirmative consent; sharing sexualized images or text.

**4.5 Disruption.** Sustained interruption of talks, forums, or meetings; heckling; intoxication to the point of disruption; pressuring others to consume alcohol or substances; fomenting hostility.

**4.6 Spam, Fraud, and Abuse.** Malicious advertising or bots; phishing; scraping or data collection without permission; distributing malware; evading safety or rate limits.

**4.7 Retaliation and Bad‑Faith Reporting.** Retaliation against good‑faith reporters or witnesses; knowingly false or malicious reports.

## 5. Reporting

If you experience or witness a violation, or have safety concerns:

* **Email:** [coc@zelo.sh](mailto:coc@zelo.sh)
* **Event Contacts:** Posted on‑site and in event materials.

Please include what happened, when/where, who was involved, and any evidence (links, screenshots). Anonymous reports are allowed. Reports are handled confidentially within legal limits.

**Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** with next steps.

---

## 6. Enforcement

Investigations are led by T&S and may include legal, HR, and moderators as appropriate. Outcomes are proportionate to impact and history, and may include:

1. Private coaching or warning
2. Content moderation (edit/remove/lock)
3. Temporary restrictions or suspension
4. Removal from events or spaces
5. Long‑term or permanent ban
6. Contract/vendor termination or employment action (where applicable)

**Immediate action.** We may remove individuals who present an immediate safety risk while we investigate.

**Appeals.** You may appeal within **14 days** of the decision to **[coc-appeals@zelo.sh](mailto:coc-appeals@zelo.sh)**. Appeals are reviewed by members not involved in the initial decision.

**No retaliation.** Retaliation against any person who reports or participates in an investigation is a serious violation.

---

## 7. Moderator & Organizer Guidelines

* Publish and pin this CoC in community spaces; highlight it during event openings.
* Display emergency and anti‑abuse contacts prominently.
* Use educational coaching for first‑time minor issues; escalate promptly for repeated or major violations.
* Keep factual records, preserve evidence, and protect privacy.

---

## 8. Inclusion Practices

* Provide accessibility features (captions, accessible routes, clear audio, written summaries).
* Respect pronouns and titles; use gender‑neutral language where possible; avoid stereotypes.
* Offer asynchronous participation (docs, issue templates, recordings) for time zones and non‑native speakers.

---

## 9. Privacy, Data, and Safety

* Collect only what is necessary for handling reports; restrict access; retain for the shortest period required by law or operations.
* If there is an immediate risk to personal safety, we may contact venue/platform operators or law enforcement within the minimum scope necessary.

---

## 10. Conflicts of Interest

Any person with a conflict of interest in a report or investigation must recuse themselves from related decisions.

---

## 11. Off‑Platform Conduct

When conduct outside Zelo spaces materially affects community safety or trust (e.g., targeted harassment, doxxing, credible threats), Zelo may take community actions consistent with this CoC after careful review.
